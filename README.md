# DL-Cpp

Popular Neural Network models implemented in C++ 

## Aim
- Create Deep Learning models with simple `cfg` ([`libconfig++`](https://github.com/hyperrealm/libconfig)) files.
- Modularize the creation of models to enable more designing (through `cfg`) then programming.
- Self-learning and Experimentation on model architectures, scalar and vectorized code (scalar vs `CUDA` vs `SIMD`) performance comparison, autodiff etc.

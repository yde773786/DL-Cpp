### Playground

Tensorflow's [A Neural Network Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org) is a great resource to visualize the training and testing of a neural network.

Use a similar set of datasets and architecture in an implementation using a popular ML framework, inspired from [the corresponding source code](https://github.com/tensorflow/playground/blob/master/src/playground.ts) for testing `DL-CPP`

Goals:
- Use Tensorflow playground as a comfortable choice to tinker hyperparameters to evaluate correctness + benchmark `DL-CPP`
